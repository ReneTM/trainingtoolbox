// Mission files describe the metadata needed by campaign-specific add-ons so they can be 
// integrated into Left4Dead. The data in this file is used by the game UI, matchmaking and server.
// Although you may provide multiple Campaigns in one add-on by putting more than one .TXT file 
// in the missions folder, it's generally a good idea to stick to one per add-on.
//
// HOW TO DEBUG MISSION FILES:
//	In the console set "developer 2"
//	Then type "mission_reload"
// This will make the game reload all the mission files and print out every chapter for every mode it
// finds.  It's very useful to ensure that your mission file is being correctly read.
